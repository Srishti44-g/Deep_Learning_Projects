## Deep Learning

## Topics
1. Forward Learning
2. Backward Learning
3. Loss Function
4. Activation Function
5. Optimizers


### Artificial Intelligence
application which can do its own without human intervention

### Narrow or Weak Artificial Intelligence
Machines that exhibits a limited extent of intelligence to accomplish a single certain simple tasks to have narrow or weak intelligence

Example: Google Search,A Self- Driviing cars, Voice based Assistants suchh as alexa and siri, any logic based game as a card game slot equipped with artificial intelligence

### Strong or Generalized Artificial Intelligence
It is the type of intelligence which makes for the slope of actual AI to be developed in future.

Example: A Self -learning diagnostic system loaded with information with disease and possible symptoms along with rules to diagnose the disease.
A teaching robot that learns by answering students queries and thereby enhancing its teaching skills
An intelligent chat bots that understood customers needs and suggests solutions solutions by its learned intelligence.
### Machine Learning
ML is a subset of AI.
Researchers in 1958

#### AI types on the basis of functionality
1. Reactive Memory
2. Limited Memory
3. Theory of mind
4. Self Awareness

### Activation Functions
1. Sigmoid Function
2. Tanh Function
3. ReLU
4. Step Function
5. Leaky ReLU Function
6. Linear function

### Optimizers
During training we adjuat the parameters to minimize the loss function and make our model as optimized as possible
Tie together the loss function and model parameters by updating the network based on the output of the loss function

### Loss Functions

### Learning Algortithms
1. Intialise parameters with random values
2. feed inputs data to inputs
3. compare predicted values with expected value and calculate loss
4. Back through the network 
5. Update parameter based ont the loss
6. Iterate previous steps till loss is minimized
