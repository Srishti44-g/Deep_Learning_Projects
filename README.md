## Deep Learning

## Topics
1. Forward Learning
2. Backward Learning
3. Loss Function
4. Activation Function
5. Optimizers


### Artificial Intelligence
application which can do its own without human intervention

### Narrow or Weak Artificial Intelligence
Machines that exhibits a limited extent of intelligence to accomplish a single certain simple tasks to have narrow or weak intelligence

Example: Google Search,A Self- Driviing cars, Voice based Assistants suchh as alexa and siri, any logic based game as a card game slot equipped with artificial intelligence

### Strong or Generalized Artificial Intelligence
It is the type of intelligence which makes for the slope of actual AI to be developed in future.

Example: A Self -learning diagnostic system loaded with information with disease and possible symptoms along with rules to diagnose the disease.
A teaching robot that learns by answering students queries and thereby enhancing its teaching skills
An intelligent chat bots that understood customers needs and suggests solutions solutions by its learned intelligence.
### Machine Learning
ML is a subset of AI.
Researchers in 1958
